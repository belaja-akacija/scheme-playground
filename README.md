# Scheme Playground
My scheme projects, similar to my other repo that is in Common Lisp.
I mainly use Scheme to extend Lilypond, so there will probably be a decent amount of functions written specifically for Lilypond.

## Contents
- pralls -- a bunch of functions that make it much easier to add ornaments to notes, without having to type it in all manually. This is mainly useful for notating Balkan folk music, or any other types of music that make heavy use of grace-note-like ornaments.
- little-schemer -- me just working through the book `The Little Schemer`.
